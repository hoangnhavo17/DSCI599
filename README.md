## Dataset Information
The project uses three key datasets:

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how customer segmentation using RFM analysis can uncover valuable marketing insights. Tailored strategies for specific customer groups, such as Baby Boomers, Silent Gen, and Millennials, can help H&M enhance customer loyalty and boost sales.
